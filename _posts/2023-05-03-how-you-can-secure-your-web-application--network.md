> Monitoring your network or a web server is essential to ensure that it is secure and performing optimally. Here are some steps you can take to monitor your web server for security.

### Install a Firewall

A firewall can help prevent unauthorized access to your web server. You can use a hardware or software firewall to monitor incoming and outgoing traffic.

### Implement Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDS/IPS)

Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) can detect and block attacks in real-time. These systems can be set up to alert you when there are security breaches, such as attempts to access restricted files or directories.

### Use SSL Certificates

SSL certificates can help protect sensitive information transmitted between the web server and clients by encrypting the data. Use HTTPS instead of HTTP to secure the connection.
