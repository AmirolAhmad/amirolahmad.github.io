How to achieve that?
: In this post, I will not go in deep (maybe next time I will share the video).

So with ngrok, you are able to use **metasploit/payload** as _listener_ and use local web server to host the **malware/trojan** so that the user (poor victim) who visiting the page are able to download and run the payload.
