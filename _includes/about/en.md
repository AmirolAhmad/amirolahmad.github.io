Hey, I am Amirol Ahmad (a.k.a. _@xambit_). I worked as Sr. Software Engineer at [CSI Interfusion Sdn Bhd](https://www.csi-interfusion.com/).

I considered myself as a hybrid between a software engineer specifically into the programming languages theories and system administration (i.e. server, cloud computing, ethical hacker, virtual machine, runtime systems, garbage collection), and a creative technologiest deeply caring about many humanistic aspects (e.g. visual, sound, interaction) in UI and HCI in general.

I'm also previously worked on the [Singapore Power Digital](https://www.spgroup.com.sg/sp-digital/overview), some other projects under the [Singapore Power](https://www.spgroup.com.sg/), [AIA Malaysia](https://www.aia.com.my/en/index.html), and [TNB Malaysia](https://www.mytnb.com.my/) as an efforts at CSI Interfusion Sdn Bhd.

In the past, I worked with [Osem Network](https://www.osemnetwork.com.my/) as System Administration and Security Consultant, and many more. You can checkout my [Linkedin](https://my.linkedin.com/in/amirolahmad).

Previously active with RailsGirl Community, Mozilla MY Translations, etc.
